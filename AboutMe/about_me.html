        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Thierry, Mekontso. I grew up learning mathematics. After completion of the bachelor degree in 2013, I taught Mathematics for 6 years in high school (from 2013 to 2019). In 2019, I decided to move to the US and once here, I switched my career to IT. I earned an Associate degree in Computer and Information Technology last December. With no professional experience, I was struggling to jump into the industry. Therefore, a friend told me about Revature and decided to join a cohort 5 months ago. I have passion for IT in general, equipped with strong problem-solving skills, and love to work in a collaborative environment where people of different backgrounds share competencies, apply their knowledge to reach the same goal.
            My hard work so far has rewarded me with a few certifications: a CompTia Security+ - Network Pro - Qualys Vulnerability & Asset Management.
            My goal is to be confident when I talk about software engineering, build the skills that I need to be helpful whenever I get hired, and become a successful Software engineer.</p>
